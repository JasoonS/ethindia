        This project was created at the #ETHIndia2019 hackathon in roughly
        35hrs. The purpose of the project is two fold:
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        1. To generate funds for wildlife conservation. How? We created a
        project called wildcards.world at the #ETHCapeTown2019 hackathon to
        raise funds for wildlife conservation. Subsequently, we have got into a
        6 month blockchain incubator in Paris to accelerate the developement of
        this platform. The funds generated from our #ETHIndia 'always for sale
        adspace' will provide funding for us to devlop our wildcards project and
        hence raise funds for conservation efforts.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        2. This project is a continued social experiment to understand how
        always for sale adspace might behave in a viral marketplace. Many of you
        may be famiailir of the milliondollarhomepage and how this simple
        project sold a million pixels at a dolar each. This extends this concept
        but rather aims at scarcity and introduces a very interesting concept
        where each piece of marketing real estate will be always for sale,
        forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        The success of this project will allow us to provide always for sale
        plugin marketing solutions to other companies and continue to fund the
        developement of wildcards - the exploration of sustainable solutions
        using an always for sale mechanic.
